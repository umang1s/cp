/*
It has worst case O(N^2)
It does minimum memory writes.can useful where memory size is costely.
Useful for solving mimimum swap to sort an array

    example
    20 40 50 10 30
    starts from 20 and count number of smalller elements in array(<20)=1
    now we put 20 at 1 position and take element of 1 position=40

    now repeat this process
